					My son who works in IT suggested I try this app after I was getting lots of strange
					messages and things happening on my phone. Since running it once a week I have had no
					viruses or malware problems. I also got a VPN app so I think with both I’m all set!

					Love the ease and efficiency. Awesome app. Very informative and insightful if wanting to

					This app is good if you need to identify certain vulnerabilities on your iPhone. If you
					have any issues, their customer service was quite helpful and responsive.

					I wish they had a VPN, I’d be signing up for that too. Apart from that the app is top
					notch. I had Certo on my last phone and it was the first app I put on this phone when I
					got it from the store. The scanner and other parts of the app are really easy and simple
					to use, even for a non-techie like me
